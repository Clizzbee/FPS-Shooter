FPS Starter Kit Pro - C++ + Blueprint Hybrid
============================================

This is a Marketplace-ready starter kit scaffold for Unreal Engine (recommended UE 5.3+).
It includes a production-oriented folder structure, C++ class skeletons, example DataTables,
documentation and packaging tips to prepare the asset for sale.

IMPORTANT: This archive contains code and editor-friendly placeholders (text files). It does NOT
contain Unreal .uasset binary Blueprint files — you'll create Blueprints in the Editor that extend
the provided C++ classes. Detailed step-by-step instructions are in the `Docs/` folder.

Quick start:
1. Extract into your Unreal project root or create a new plugin / module and copy Source/ and Content/ folders.
2. Open the Visual Studio / Xcode solution, add the FPSKit module, compile.
3. In Unreal Editor, create BPs that extend the C++ classes in Source/FPSKit.
