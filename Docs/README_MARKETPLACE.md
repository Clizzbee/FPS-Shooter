--------------------------------------------
1. Clean folder structure (Content/FPSKit, Source/FPSKit).
2. Include a demo map/use-case level showing kit features.
3. Provide detailed documentation (Install, Quick Start, Examples).
4. Include a short tutorial video or GIFs (recommended).
5. Make sure all third-party assets included have redistributable licenses.
6. Provide a clear EULA / License and support contact.

Packaging recommendations:

- Provide a "Lite" and "Full" pack if including heavy content.
- Test cooking for Windows (and other target platforms if you claim support).
